# 🧪 To-Do List CRUD Testing Project

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on testing a **To-Do List web application** using the **CRUD testing approach** —  
**Create, Read, Update, and Delete**.  
Each operation was thoroughly validated through functional test scenarios designed in **Trello** and later exported for documentation on GitHub.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To ensure the To-Do List application works correctly across all core data operations by:
- Verifying users can **create, view, update, and delete** tasks.
- Testing input validation, UI behavior, and data consistency.
- Confirming that counters (like “items left”) and sections (All / Active / Completed) update accurately.

### 🟢 CREATE

### 🔵 READ
Focus: Viewing and filtering tasks.  


### 🟡 UPDATE
Focus: Modifying task names and statuses.  


### 🔴 DELETE
